Your solution will be verified by a MD5/SHA256 checksum. Your script should be able to generate a file containing all puzzles and their solutions. However, the file will also be manually inspected, so don't try to get a hash collision. Your output file should match:

MD5: 41704fd7d8fd0723a45ffbb2dbbfa488
SHA256: 0bc8dda364db7b99f389b42383e37b411d9fa022204d124cb3c8959eba252f05

The file will be on the format:

<num_puzzles>
<unsolved_puzzle#1>,<solved_puzzle#1>
<unsolved_puzzle#2>,<solved_puzzle#2>
...
<unsolved_puzzle#n>,<solved_puzzle#n>

with a single trailing newline.
